# ðŸ”¥ Fire Detection Using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect fire in images. The model is trained on a dataset containing images with and without fire, aiming to accurately classify them.

## ðŸ§  Model

- **Model type**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
- **Input**: Images (fire / non-fire)
- **Output**: Binary classification

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

Dataset used: [Fire Detection Dataset]
Each folder contains sample images used for training and testing the model.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
